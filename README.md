        1.Name of the product\n
        2.Rate\n
        3.Quantity\n
        4.Total(Quantity*Rate)
2. Admin
 	As part of the admin menu
	   1.You can add to the quantity of existing Inventory
    	   2.You can remove from the quantity of existing Inventory

The Inventory is updated everytime the a billing or a change is made to the inventory by admin.
